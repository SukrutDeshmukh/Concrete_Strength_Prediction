# Basic Information related to the project 
 
1) Concrete is a composite material made up of fine and coarse aggregates combined with cement paste, which solidifies and strengthens over time.
2) Cement is a crucial component in the preparation of concrete, contributing approximately 22% to the composition.
3) India holds the position of the second-largest cement producer globally, with a share of over 7% of the total installed capacity.
4) In FY 2022, the domestic production of cement in India reached 356 million tons, indicating a growth from 296 million tons in FY 2021.

# Project Information

The main goal of this project is to thoroughly examine a given dataset and apply various machine learning models to it. The dataset contains information about the composition of concrete, and the ultimate objective is to predict the strength of the concrete based on the provided composition data. The project aims to evaluate different machine learning models and determine the most suitable model that yields accurate predictions for the dataset.

# Dataset Features Information

1) Cement: The amount of cement (in kg/m³) used in the concrete mixture.
2) Slag: The amount of slag (in kg/m³) included in the concrete mixture.
3) Flyash: The quantity of fly ash (in kg/m³) incorporated in the concrete mixture.
4) Water: The volume of water (in kg/m³) used during the preparation of concrete.
5) Superplasticizer: The amount of superplasticizer (in kg/m³) added to improve the workability of the concrete.
6) Coarse Aggregate: The proportion of coarse aggregate (in kg/m³) used in the concrete mixture. This typically consists of gravel or crushed stone.
7) Fine Aggregate: The proportion of fine aggregate (in kg/m³) used in the concrete mixture. This usually refers to sand.
8) Age: The age of the concrete sample (in days) at the time of testing for strength.
9) csMPa: The compressive strength of the concrete sample (in MPa), which is the target variable to be predicted.

These features provide crucial information about the composition and age of the concrete samples, and the target variable (csMPa) represents the measured compressive strength of the concrete.
